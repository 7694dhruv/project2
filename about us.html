<h2>Book Appointment:</h2>
<p align="justify" >To book an appointment at a hospital, you usually need to follow specific steps. First, you'll need to contact the hospital, either by phone or online, to schedule the appointment. They may require information such as your full name, date of birth, insurance details (if applicable), and a brief description of the reason for the appointment. Depending on the doctor's availability and the type of appointment needed, you may be scheduled for a specific date and time. If you need to cancel or reschedule, it's important to contact the hospital as soon as possible to allow someone else to use that slot.
